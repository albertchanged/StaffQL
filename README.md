## How It Works ##
You can:
1. Add a new staff member
2. Search for staff by their names, roles, or departments
3. Edit a staff member's information
4. Remove a staff member

## How To Use It ##
You will need to set up a MongoDB database (mLabs is great!) and assign
a user to it.

After that, here are the steps to set up:

1. Clone this repository to your computer
2. Navigate to StaffQL from your command line
3. Run ```npm install```
4. Open the project in your favorite code editor
5. Replace the mongo.user and mongo.password located in ```server/server.js``` with your own mLabs credentials
6. Run ```npm run dev``` in your command line
7. Navigate to localhost:4000 in your browser
8. Enjoy!
